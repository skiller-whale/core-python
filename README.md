# Skiller Whale, Exercises for Core Python

This repo includes exercises to accompany Skiller Whale sessions on the core features of Python 3

During each session you'll be asked to write and edit code in some of the files. 

The `sync.py` script is used to share your files with the person leading the session, so that they can see the code you're writing, and help out when needed.

"""
These fortunes are based on the old English rhyme, Monday's child:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday's_Child

Monday's child is fair of face
Tuesday's child is full of grace,
Wednesday's child is full of woe,
Thursday's child has far to go,
Friday's child is loving and giving,
Saturday's child works hard for a living,
But the child who is born on the Sabbath Day
Is bonny and blithe and good and gay.
